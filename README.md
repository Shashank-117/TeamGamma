# TeamGamma
We propose an automatic exposure correction pipeline that estimates under- and over-exposed regions using dual illumination and fuses them into a balanced result. It combines Retinex-based illumination estimation with Mertensâ€™ fusion and is evaluated on challenging real-world datasets using our custom Python implementation.
