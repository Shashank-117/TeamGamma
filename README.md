# TeamGamma
We propose an automatic exposure correction pipeline that estimates under- and over-exposed regions using dual illumination and fuses them into a balanced result. It combines Retinex-based illumination estimation with Mertensâ€™ fusion and is evaluated on challenging real-world datasets using our custom Python implementation.

Steps:-
- Output already present in kernel of jupyter notebook (size big for display on github)
- Download the jupyter notebook
- if run :
      - upload all the images from the test images folder in the notebook directly
